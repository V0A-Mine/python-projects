## ⚙️ How It Works
- The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list.  
- You choose a **difficulty level**, which determines how long or short the words are:
  - 🟢 **Easy** → Words with ≤ 5 letters  
  - 🟡 **Medium** → Words with 6–8 letters  
  - 🔴 **Hard** → Words with > 8 letters  
- You have **6 total attempts**.  
- For every incorrect guess, part of the hangman appears.  
- The game ends when:
  - You guess the full word ✅
  - or all attempts are used up 💀
