def guess_num_bot(max_number, max_attempt):
    """
    🎯 Let the bot try to guess the number you're thinking of.

    The bot will attempt to guess a number between 1 and `max_number`.
    After each guess, you must tell the bot if its guess was correct,
    too high, or too low. The bot continues until it either guesses correctly
    or runs out of attempts.

    Parameters:
        max_number (int): The upper limit of the number range (e.g., 100).
        max_attempt (int): The maximum number of guesses the bot can make.

    Returns:
        None
