# ✅ To-Do List (Python Console App)


## 📝 Description

This project is a **console-based task manager** where users can:
- Create a list of things they want to do.
- Mark completed tasks using a simple menu.
- Delete tasks when they’re done.
- See how many tasks are currently in the list.

It’s built entirely with **basic Python concepts** like lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions — making it a perfect small project for beginners who want to practice logic building and input handling.
