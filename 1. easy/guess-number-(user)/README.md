# 🎯 Number Guessing Game  

## 📝 Description  
**Number Guessing Game** is a simple Python project where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a given range.  
Each incorrect guess reduces your remaining attempts until you either guess the number correctly or run out of tries.  

This project helps beginners learn about:  
- 🎲 Using the `random` module to generate random numbers  
- 🔁 Looping (`while`) for continuous gameplay  
- 🧠 Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- ⚠️ Input validation and error handling using `try` and `except`

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. The program randomly picks a number between **1 and the upper limit** (for example, 1–10).  
2. You will be asked to guess the number.  
3. If your guess is correct — 🎉 Congratulations! You win.  
4. If your guess is incorrect — you lose one attempt.  
5. When you run out of attempts, the correct number is revealed.  
6. After the game ends, a “Thanks for playing!” message is displayed.
