# ✊🖐️✌️ Rock Paper Scissors

## 📝 Description
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple Python game where you play against the computer.  
Each round, you choose between **Rock (R)**, **Paper (P)**, or **Scissors (S)** — and the program randomly selects one too!  
The winner is determined by the traditional game rules.

This project helps beginners understand:
* 🔁 **Loops** (`while`)
* 🔍 **Conditional statements** (`if`, `else`)
* 🎲 **The `random` module** to generate random choices
* 💬 **User input validation** and clean console output
* 🧩 **Modular code** using multiple functions

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program asks you to choose between Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S).  
2. The computer randomly picks one as well.  
3. The winner is decided based on the game rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Paper beats Rock  
   - Scissors beat Paper  
4. You’ll see the result (win/lose/tie) and can choose to play again.  
5. The game continues until you type “n” or “no”.

## 💻 Example Output
Choose Rock (R) / Paper (P) / Scissors (S): r

You win 🥇, user: (R), bot: (S)

Play again? (y/n): y

Choose Rock (R) / Paper (P) / Scissors (S): p

It's a tie 👏, user: (P), bot: (P)
